# Hi, I'm Prince! 👋

I am interested in coding and constantly strive to minimize errors in my work 🙂. I am eager to learn new skills and land my first job.

## What I'm Currently Learning 🌱

I am currently focused on MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) development. In my college studies, I learned C++ in my first year and Java in my second year. I'm excited to see what awaits me in my third year as a BCA student.

## Collaboration Interests 💞️

I am open to collaborating on web development projects and Java projects. Let me know if you have any interesting projects in mind.
